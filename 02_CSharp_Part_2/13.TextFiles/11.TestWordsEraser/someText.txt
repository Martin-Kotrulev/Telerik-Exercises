Now and then TeSt I think of when we were together
Like when you said TEST you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that you test were right for me
But felt so lonely in your test company
But that was testlove and it's an star tache I still remember

test You can get addicted to a certain kinda sadness
Like testresignation to the end, always the end
So when testwetest found that we could not make sense
Well you said that test we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was TEST glad that it was over

ButSTART start you didn't have to cut me off
Make it like it TESTnever happened and that we were nothing
I don't even need your TeSTlove, but you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so roughteST

test No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have TEST your friends collect your records
And then TEST change your number
Guess that I test don't need that though
Now you're just testsomebody that I used to know

Now you're just testsomebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebodytest that I used to know

testNow and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But testhad me believin it was always something that I'd done
But I don'ttest wanna live that way
Reading into everytest word you say
You said that you couldtest let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hungTest up on somebody that you used to know-oh-oh
