Now and thenstart I think of when we were together
Like when you saidstart you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that youstart were right for me
But felt so lonely in yourstart company
But that was love and it's an startache I still remember

startYou can get addicted to a certain kinda sadness
Likestart resignation to the end, always the end
So when startwestart found that we could not make sense
Well you said thatstart we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I wasstart glad that it was over

Butstart startyou didn't have to cut me off
Make it like itstart never happened and that we were nothing
I don't even need your love, but you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough

startNo, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have startyour friends collect your records
And then startchange your number
Guess that I startdon't need that though
Now you're just startsomebody that I used to know

Now you're just startsomebody that I used to know
Now you're just startsomebody that I used to know

startNow and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But starthad me believin it was always something that I'd done
But I don'tstart wanna live that way
Reading into everystart word you say
You said that you couldstart let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hungstart up on somebody that you used to know-oh-oh

startBut you didn't have cut me off
Make startit like it never happened and that we were nothing (oh)
I don't evenstart need your love, but you treat me like a stranger
and that feels so roughstart

(oh)

No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect you records
And then change your number (oh)
Guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody that I used to know
Somebody (now your just somebody that I used to know)
That I used to know
Somebody that I used to know
Somebody (somebody) (now your just somebody that I used to know)
That I used to know

I used to know
That I used to know
I used to know
