Now and thenfinish I think of when we were together
Like when you saidfinish you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that youfinish were right for me
But felt so lonely in yourfinish company
But that was love and it's an finishache I still remember

finishYou can get addicted to a certain kinda sadness
Likefinish resignation to the end, always the end
So when finishwefinish found that we could not make sense
Well you said thatfinish we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I wasfinish glad that it was over

Butfinish finishyou didn't have to cut me off
Make it like itfinish never happened and that we were nothing
I don't even need your love, but you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough

finishNo, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have finishyour friends collect your records
And then finishchange your number
Guess that I finishdon't need that though
Now you're just finishsomebody that I used to know

Now you're just finishsomebody that I used to know
Now you're just finishsomebody that I used to know

finishNow and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But finishhad me believin it was always something that I'd done
But I don'tfinish wanna live that way
Reading into everyfinish word you say
You said that you couldfinish let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hungfinish up on somebody that you used to know-oh-oh

finishBut you didn't have cut me off
Make finishit like it never happened and that we were nothing (oh)
I don't evenfinish need your love, but you treat me like a stranger
and that feels so roughfinish

(oh)

No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect you records
And then change your number (oh)
Guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody that I used to know
Somebody (now your just somebody that I used to know)
That I used to know
Somebody that I used to know
Somebody (somebody) (now your just somebody that I used to know)
That I used to know
