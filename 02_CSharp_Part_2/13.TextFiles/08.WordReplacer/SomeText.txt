Now and then sTaRt I think of when we were together
Like when you said start you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that you START were right for me
But felt so lonely in your start company
But that was love and it's an star tache I still remember

start You can get addicted to a certain kinda sadness
Like start resignation to the end, always the end
So when start westart found that we could not make sense
Well you said that start we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was start glad that it was over

Butstart start you didn't have to cut me off
Make it like it start never happened and that we were nothing
I don't even need your love, but you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough

start No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have start your friends collect your records
And then start change your number
Guess that I start don't need that though
Now you're just start somebody that I used to know

Now you're just startsomebody that I used to know
Now you're just startsomebody that I used to know

startNow and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But starthad me believin it was always something that I'd done
But I don'tstart wanna live that way
Reading into everystart word you say
You said that you couldstart let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hungstart up on somebody that you used to know-oh-oh

startBut you didn't have cut me off
Make startit like it never happened and that we were nothing (oh)
I don't evenstart need your love, but you treat me like a stranger
and that feels so roughstart

(oh)

No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect you records
And then change your number (oh)
Guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody that I used to know
Somebody (now your just somebody that I used to know)
That I used to know
Somebody that I used to know
Somebody (somebody) (now your just somebody that I used to know)
