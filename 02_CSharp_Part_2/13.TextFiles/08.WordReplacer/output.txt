Now and then sTaRt I think of when we were together
Like when you said finish you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that you START were right for me
But felt so lonely in your finish company
But that was love and it's an star tache I still remember

finish You can get addicted to a certain kinda sadness
Like finish resignation to the end, always the end
So when finish westart found that we could not make sense
Well you said that finish we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was finish glad that it was over

Butstart finish you didn't have to cut me off
Make it like it finish never happened and that we were nothing
I don't even need your love, but you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough

finish No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have finish your friends collect your records
And then finish change your number
Guess that I finish don't need that though
Now you're just finish somebody that I used to know

Now you're just startsomebody that I used to know
Now you're just startsomebody that I used to know

startNow and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But starthad me believin it was always something that I'd done
But I don'tstart wanna live that way
Reading into everystart word you say
You said that you couldstart let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hungstart up on somebody that you used to know-oh-oh

startBut you didn't have cut me off
Make startit like it never happened and that we were nothing (oh)

No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect you records
And then change your number (oh)
Guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
